# DoorHop
About this Project

DoorHop integrates RFID tags in our I-cards with the door locking systems in workplaces to allow people visiting offices to leave virtual messages in the form of e-mails and SMS in case the office holder is not available.

Aim of this Project

The aim of the project is to seamlessly integrate multiple services such as Twilio and Google Voice in order to facilitate communication between colleagues easier even when they aren't present at their offices.

Implementation

We used the Twilio API including the REST API and the TwiML API to connect the tap of the ID card on the door to a message being sent to the user.
